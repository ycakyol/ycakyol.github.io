 <font size=4>&nbsp; &nbsp;  My name is Yağmur Ceren AKYOL.I am a third grade computer engineering student at Anadolu University. I was born in Amasya at 1996.
 I graduated high school at Amasya and then I came in Eskisehir for university. My family still live in Amasya. I have a sister who named Cemre 
 and 16 years old and I have a brother who named Eren and 14 years old.They are at highschool and my brother also want to be computer engineer.
 I have not too much hobbies or abilities but I really love reading book, especially science fiction and clasicks. It does not matter türkish or
 world clasics I love to read them all. Victor Hugo and J.K Rowling are my favorite writers. My turkish favorite writers are Yahya Kemal and İhsan
 Oktay Anar. Nowadays I have not much time to read because of school so I try to be better student. When I have free time(it happens realy rarely
 by the way) I do coding on my own to learn better and to love my future job.
